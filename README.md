# skin-disease-classifier
This project is a deep learning-based skin disease classification system that leverages the VGG16 convolutional neural network to identify various types of skin diseases from medical images. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of skin conditions and classifies an input image into one of nine skin disease categories.
